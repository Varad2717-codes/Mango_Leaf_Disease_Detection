# projec-Mango_leaf_disease_detection
 A deep learning-based web application built to detect diseases in mango leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of mango leaf images and accurately classifies multiple types of diseases. The system is designed to assist farmers and researchers by identifying plant health issues early and recommending remedies.  🔍 Features: Image-based mango leaf disease classification using CNN.  Trained on a dataset with 38 disease classes (customizable).  Modern Streamlit web interface with animated UI and multilingual remedy support (English, Hindi, Marathi).  Glassmorphism-inspired design with dark/light mode toggle, hover effects, and loading spinners.  Downloadable remedies and in-app translation toggle.  Mobile responsive and user-friendly layout.  📦 Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras  OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas  Streamlit (for frontend)  CSS for custom UI styling  Multilingual support via translation libraries or custom implementation  📁 Dataset: Custom mango leaf disease dataset collected from [Kaggle/source]  Preprocessed and augmented for better generalization  🚀 How to Use: Upload an image of a mango leaf.  Let the CNN model analyze the image.  View predicted disease and suggested remedies in your preferred language such as (English,Marathi & Hindi).
